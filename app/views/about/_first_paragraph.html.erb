Music Bee is a company that supplies CDs of
<%= link_to 'Liturgical', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgical' %>
Music for use in Primary Schools. It was started by Carmel Thomas,
herself a Catholic Music Teacher in Essex, UK, after she realised
that there was a shortage of musicians available to aid the
use of Liturgical Music in Catholic Primary Schools. She was
constantly being asked by other schools for copies of her own
music on CD and has now produced a series of CDs called
‘Carmel Plays’, which are now used in schools throughout the UK.
